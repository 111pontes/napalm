.. note::
    There is a chance that some participants have no prior experience with GitHub, python, napalm or even collaborating on big software projects. So we will have random sessions that will be recorded and published to explain some ideas like how to fork a project and submit a PR or what does pylama do or how do I test my code works, etc... This will be improvised and will depend on the types of questions people ask to the :doc:`mentors <mentors>`.
