This project was founded by David Barroso as part of [Spotify][spotify] and Elisa Jasinska as part of [BigWave IT][bigwave]. Originally it was hosted by the [Spotify][spotify] organization but due to the many contributions received by third parties we agreed creating a dedicated organization for NAPALM and give a big thanks to [Spotify][spotify] for the support.
